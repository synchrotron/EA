## Name and Alias

When naming an item please avoid acronym and use the full name in the Name field and use the Alias field for any acronym. An example of this would be [Advance Scheduling System](https://channel4.leanix.net/Channel4Prod/factsheet/Application/af539ba8-e622-46fc-b561-347dad93d8b6) aka A55. The benefit of this approach means that reporting has meaningful names while also possible to search using acronyms.

Provide a concise description of the application, keep in mind that the reader is likely not to have as much knowledge of the systems as yourself, so keep it high level and business focused.

>[!info] Tip
> By having all the acronyms in LeanIX it has become a de-facto glossary of terms. If you find yourself hearing a system but not knowing what it is, you can search for that term.

## Subscriptions
Collecting and maintaining accurate data is crucial for EAM. To address the challenge of managing large amounts of data and ensuring its accuracy over time, it's important you take responsibility and accountability and contribute in your specific area of knowledge and expertise. By subscribing to Fact Sheets ensures the right people are notified and have a clear call-to-action to maintain and administer the data. 

### Subscription Types
There are two **types** of subscriptions
#### Responsible
These users are in charge of keeping the Fact Sheet up to-date and correct. The subscribed user actively participates in the content creation and updates of the Fact Sheet.
#### Observer
These users are notified and kept up-to-date regarding changes to Fact Sheets. They can also participate in Surveys but are not responsible for maintaining the information in the Fact Sheets.

### Subscription Roles
We have identified 10 roles that help define your purpose with the factsheet.

While it is possible for a BA to take responsibilities for any factsheet it is expected to concentrate on the following:

A Business Owner can be responsibility for or an observer of any factsheet but with a focus on the following:

## Quality Seal
This provides a level of data integrity. While it's possible for any users (with non viewer role ) to change any factsheet, the Quality Seal prompts those responsible (see above) to confirm the changes and certify the factsheet is accurate.

The 4 stages of a quality seal

## Completion Percentage
By having a high completion percentage reflects back that the factsheets have been considered and well maintained. One very simple way to increase the percentage is to select **Leave empty** against properties that are not relevant to a factsheet.

For instance, it is rare for an application to have a Child relationship
